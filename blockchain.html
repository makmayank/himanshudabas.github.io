	<h1 >Blockchain</h1>
	<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
	<p>The blockchain is an undeniably ingenious invention – the brainchild of a person or group of people known by the pseudonym,  Satoshi Nakamoto. 
	But since then, it has evolved into something greater, and the main question every single person is asking is: What is Blockchain?
	By allowing digital information to be distributed but not copied, blockchain technology created the backbone of a new type of internet. Originally devised
	for the digital currency, <a href="http://cbsblockchain.org/bitcoin "  target="_blank">Bitcoin</a>, the tech community is now finding other potential uses for the technology.
	</p>
	<p id= "quote">“The blockchain is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic 
	transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions but
	virtually everything of value.”
							Don & Alex Tapscott, authors Blockchain Revolution (2016)
	</p>
	<h2>How this thing works</h2>
	<p> Suppose a spreadsheet that is duplicated thousands of times and shared to persons you know (or don't,doesn't matter).
	All those who have this doc are conncted to a network. Then imagine that this network is designed to regularly 
	update this spreadsheet. You got the  basic idea behind blockchain. You may wonder why do we need this? Coming to that!
	Information held on a blockchain exists as a shared — and continually reconciled — database.The blockchain database isn’t
	stored in any single location, meaning the records it keeps are truly public,provides tranparency
	and easily verifiable. No centralized version of this information exists for a hacker to corrupt. 
	Hosted by millions of computers simultaneously, 
	its data is accessible to anyone on the internet.</p>
	<h2>Blockchain features</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Blockchain's Durability and robustness</li>
		<p>Blockchain technology is like the internet in that it has a built-in robustness. By storing blocks of information 
		that are identical across its network, the blockchain <br>
		:Cannot be controlled by any single entity.<br>
		:Has no single point of failure.<br>
		Bitcoin was invented in 2008. Since that time, the Bitcoin blockchain has operated without
		significant disruption. (To date, any of problems associated with Bitcoin have been due to hacking or mismanagement. In other words, 
		these problems come from bad intention and human error, not flaws in the underlying concepts.)
		</p>
		<li>Transparent and incorruptible</li>
		<p>The blockchain network lives in a state of consensus, one that automatically checks in with itself every ten minutes. 
		A kind of self-auditing ecosystem of a digital value, the network reconciles every transaction that happens in ten-minute intervals.
		Each group of these transactions is referred to as a “block”. Two important properties result from this:
		Transparency data is embedded within the network as a whole, by definition it is public.
		It cannot be corrupted altering any unit of information on the blockchain would mean using a huge amount of computing power to override the entire network.</p>
		
	</ul>
	<h2>Decentralization : Decrypted</h2>
		<p>By design, the blockchain is a decentralized technology.Anything that happens on it is a
		function of the network as a whole. Some important implications stem from this. By creating a new 
		way to verify transactions aspects of traditional commerce could become unnecessary. Stock market
		trades become almost simultaneous on the blockchain, for instance — or it could make types of record keeping,
		like a land registry, fully public. And decentralization is already a reality.
		A global network of computers uses blockchain technology to jointly manage the database that records Bitcoin transactions.
		That is, Bitcoin is managed by its network, and not any one central authority. Decentralization means the network operates 
		on a user-to-user (or peer-to-peer) basis. The forms of mass collaboration this makes possible are just beginning to be investigated.
		</p>
		<p>Today’s internet has security problems that are familiar to everyone. We all rely on the 
		“username/password” system to protect our identity and assets online. Blockchain security methods 
		use encryption technology. The basis for this are the so-called public and private “keys”. 
		A “public key” (a long, randomly-generated string of numbers) is a users’ address on the blockchain. 
		Bitcoins sent across the network gets recorded as belonging to that address. The “private key” is like a password that gives
		its owner access to their Bitcoin or other digital assets. Store your data on the blockchain and it is incorruptible. This is true,
		although protecting your digital assets will also require safeguarding of your private key by printing it out, creating what’s referred to as a paper wallet.
		</p>
		<h2>Blockchain:A new era of Internet</h2>
		<p>Now ,You may want to know or may be thinking by now that how would this thing replace current scenarios and its possible uses. So,have a seat. </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Smart contracts		</li>
			<p>Distributed ledgers enable the coding of simple contracts that will execute when specified
			conditions are met. Ethereum is an open source blockchain project that was built specifically to 
			realize this possibility. Still, in its early stages, Ethereum has the potential to leverage the usefulness 
			of blockchains on a truly world-changing scale.At the technology’s current level of development, smart contracts can be programmed to perform simple functions. For instance , 
			a derivative could be paid out when a financial instrument meets certain benchmark, with the use of blockchain technology and
			Bitcoin enabling the payout to be automated.
			</p>
			
			
			 <li>Crowdfunding:ICO		</li>
			<p>Crowdfunding initiatives like Kickstarter and Gofundme are doing the advance work for the 
			emerging peer-to-peer economy. The popularity of these sites suggests people want to have a direct say in
			product development. Blockchains take this interest to the next level, potentially creating crowd-sourced venture capital funds.
			In 2016, one such experiment, the Ethereum-based DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), raised an astonishing $200 
			million USD in just over two months. Participants purchased “DAO tokens” allowing them to vote on smart contract venture capital 
			investments (voting power was proportionate to the number of DAO they were holding). A subsequent hack of project funds proved that 
			the project was launched without proper due diligence, with disastrous consequences.
			Regardless, the DAO experiment suggests the blockchain has the potential to usher in “a new paradigm of economic cooperation.”
			</p>
			
			<li>Governance	</li>
			<p>By making the results fully transparent and publicly accessible, distributed database 
			technology could bring full transparency to elections or any other kind of poll taking. Ethereum-based
			smart contracts help to automate the process.The app, Boardroom, enables organizational decision-making 
			to happen on the blockchain. In practice, this means company governance becomes fully transparent and 
			verifiable when managing digital assets, equity or information.
			</p>
			
			<li>Supply chain auditing</li>
			<p>Consumers increasingly want to know that the ethical claims companies make about their products are real. 
			Distributed ledgers provide an easy way to certify that the backstories of the things we buy are genuine.
			Transparency comes with blockchain-based timestamping of a date and location — on ethical diamonds, for 
			instance — that corresponds to a product number.
			The UK-based Provenance offers supply chain auditing for a range of consumer goods. Making use of the Ethereum blockchain, 
			a Provenance pilot project ensures that fish sold in Sushi restaurants in Japan has been sustainably harvested by its suppliers in Indonesia.
			</p>
			
			<li>File storage	</li>
			<p>Decentralizing file storage on the internet brings clear benefits. Distributing data throughout the network protects files from getting hacked or lost.
			Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) makes it easy to conceptualize how a distributed web might operate. Similar to the way a bittorrent
			moves data around the internet, IPFS gets rid of the need for centralized client-server relationships (i.e., the current web). 
			An internet made up of completely decentralized websites has the potential to speed up file transfer and streaming times. 
			Such an improvement is not only convenient. It’s a necessary upgrade to the web’s currently overloaded content-delivery systems.
			</p>
			<li>Copyright management
			</li>
			<p>As is well known, digital information can be infinitely reproduced — and distributed widely thanks to the internet.
			This has given web users globally a goldmine of free content. However, copyright holders have not been so lucky, losing control over 
			their intellectual property and suffering financially as a consequence. Smart contracts can protect copyright and automate the sale of 
			creative works online, eliminating the risk of file copying and redistribution.
			Mycelia uses the blockchain to create a peer-to-peer music distribution system. Founded by the UK singer-songwriter Imogen Heap, Mycelia enables musicians to sell songs 
			directly to audiences, as well as license samples to producers and divvy up royalties to songwriters and musicians — all of these functions 
			being automated by smart contracts. The capacity of blockchains to issue payments in fractional cryptocurrency amounts (micropayments) suggests this use case for 
			the blockchain has a strong chance of success.
			</p>
			
			<li>Internet of Things (IoT)</li>
			<p>What is the IoT? The network-controlled management of certain types of electronic devices — for instance,
			the monitoring of air temperature in a storage facility. Smart contracts make the automation of remote
			systems management possible. A combination of software, sensors, and the network facilitates an 
			exchange of data between objects and mechanisms. The result increases system efficiency and improves cost monitoring.
			The biggest players in manufacturing, tech and telecommunications are all vying for IoT dominance.
			IoT applications will run the gamut from predictive maintenance of mechanical parts to data analytics,
			and mass-scale automated systems management.
			</p>
			<li>Data management</li>
			<p>Today, in exchange for their personal data people can use social media platforms like Facebook for free.
			In future, users will have the ability to manage and sell the data their online activity generates. Because it
			can be easily distributed in small fractional amounts, Bitcoin — or something like it — will most likely be the 
			currency that gets used for this type of transaction.
			The MIT project Enigma understands that user privacy is the key precondition for creating of a personal data marketplace.
			Enigma uses cryptographic techniques to allow individual data sets to be split between nodes, and at the same time run bulk 
			computations over the data group as a whole. Fragmenting the data also makes Enigma scalable (unlike those blockchain solutions 
			where data gets replicated on every node). A Beta launch is promised within the next six months.</p>
			
			
			<li>Land title registration	</li>
			<p>As Publicly-accessible ledgers, blockchains can make all kinds of record-keeping more efficient.
			Property titles are a case in point. They tend to be susceptible to fraud, as well as costly and labour intensive to administer.
			A number of countries are undertaking blockchain-based land registry projects. Honduras was the first 
			government to announce such an initiative in 2015, although the current status of that project is unclear. 
			This year, the Republic of Georgia cemented a deal with the Bitfury Group to develop a blockchain system for property titles. 
			Reportedly, Hernando de Soto, the high-profile economist and property rights advocate, will be advising on the project. 
			Most recently, Sweden announced it was experimenting with a blockchain application for property titles.
