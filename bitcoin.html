	<h1 id="cryptocurrency_text" style="">Cryptocurrency</h1>
	<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
	<p>A cryptocurrency (or crypto currency) is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange using cryptography to secure the
		transactions and to control the creation of additional units of the currency.[1][2] Cryptocurrencies are classified as a subset of digital 
		currencies and are also classified as a subset of alternative currencies and virtual currencies.
		Bitcoin became the first decentralized cryptocurrency in 2009. There are 100's of cryptocurrencies in market by now ,like ethereum ,Litecoin ,Blackcoin ,Dogecoin etc., but for understanding purpose  
		we will be focusing the Top one i.e. Bitcoin<br> 
		Bitcoin is a form of digital cryptocurrency, created and held electronically. Having <strong>Blockchain</strong> holding its back. No one controls it.
		It is a consensus network that enables a new payment system and a completely digital money. 
		It is the first decentralized peer-to-peer payment network that is<strong> powered by its users with no central
		authority or middlemen</strong>. From a user perspective, Bitcoin is pretty much like cash for the Internet. 
		Also Bitcoin is a <a href="www.cbsblockchain.org/dapp" target="_blank">Ðapp</a> on <a href="www.cbsblockchain.org/blockchain" target="_blank">Blockchain</a> platform.
	</p>
	<h2>Who created Bitcoin?</h2>
		<p>
		Bitcoin is the first implementation of a concept called <strong>"cryptocurrency"</strong>.
		The first Bitcoin specification and proof of concept was published in 2009 in a cryptography mailing list by 
		Satoshi Nakamoto(person or group ,not known). Satoshi left the project in late 2010 without revealing much about himself. 
		The community has since grown exponentially with many developers working on Bitcoin.
		
		</p>
	
	
	<h2>Who controls the Bitcoin network?</h2>
		<p>
			Nobody!(seriously!),yes,Nobody owns the Bitcoin network much like no one owns the technology behind email. Bitcoin is controlled
			by all Bitcoin users around the world. While developers are improving the software, they can't force a change 
			in the Bitcoin protocol because all users are free to choose what software and version they use. In order to
			stay compatible with each other, all users need to use software complying with the same rules. Bitcoin can only 
			work correctly with a complete consensus among all users. Therefore, all users and developers have a strong 
			incentive to protect this consensus.<br>
			The Bitcoin protocol and software are published openly and any developer around the world can review the code or make their own 
			modified version of the Bitcoin software. Just like current developers, Satoshi's influence was limited to the changes he made being
			adopted by others and therefore,  even he could not control Bitcoin.
		</p>
	
	<h2>Who prints it? </h2>
		<p>
			No one. This currency isn’t physically printed in the shadows by a central bank, unaccountable to the population, and making its own rules.
			Those banks can simply produce more money to cover the national debt, thus devaluing their currency.
			Instead, bitcoin is created digitally, by a community of people that anyone can join.
			Bitcoins are generated through <strong>mining</strong>, using computing power in a distributed network.
		</p>
	
	<h2>What are the advantages of Bitcoin?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Payment freedom</li><p>It is possible to send and receive bitcoins anywhere in the world at any time.
			No bank holidays. No borders. No bureaucracy. Bitcoin allows its users to be in full control of their money.</p>
			
			<li>Fewer risks for merchants</li><p>Bitcoin transactions are secure, irreversible, and do not contain customers’ sensitive or 
			personal information. This protects merchants from losses caused by fraud or fraudulent chargebacks, and there is no need for 
			PCI compliance. Merchants can easily expand to new markets where either credit cards are not available or fraud rates are 
			unacceptably high. The net results are lower fees, larger markets, and fewer administrative costs.</p>
			
			<li>Security and control</li>:<p>Bitcoin users are in full control of their transactions; it is impossible for merchants to force 
			unwanted or unnoticed charges as can happen with other payment methods. Bitcoin payments can be made without personal 
			information tied to the transaction. This offers strong protection against identity theft. Bitcoin users can also protect their
			money with backup and encryption.</p>
			
			<li>Transparent and neutral</li>:<p>All information concerning the Bitcoin money supply itself is readily available on the blockchain 
			for anybody to verify and use in real-time. No individual or organization can control or manipulate the Bitcoin protocol because it is 
			cryptographically secure. This allows the core of Bitcoin to be trusted for being completely neutral, transparent and predictable.</p>
			
			
		</ul>
		<h2>Why do people trust Bitcoin? </h2>
		<p>		
				Much of the trust in Bitcoin comes from the fact that it requires no trust at all. Bitcoin is fully open-source and 
				decentralized. This means that anyone has access to the entire source code at any time. Any developer in the world can 
				therefore verify exactly how Bitcoin works. All transactions and bitcoins issued into existence can be transparently consulted
				in real-time by anyone. All payments can be made without reliance on a third party and the whole system is protected by heavily 
				peer-reviewed cryptographic algorithms like those used for online banking. No organization or individual can control Bitcoin, and the 
				network remains secure even if not all of its users can be trusted.
		</p>
		<h2>Is bitcoin legal?</h2>
		<p>To the best of our knowledge, Bitcoin has not been made illegal by legislation in most jurisdictions. However, some 
		jurisdictions (such as Argentina and Russia) severely restrict or ban foreign currencies.
		Other jurisdictions (such as Thailand) may limit the licensing of certain entities such as Bitcoin exchanges.<br>
		Regulators from various jurisdictions are taking steps to provide individuals and businesses with rules on how to integrate 
		this new technology with the formal, regulated financial system. For example, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), 
		a bureau in the United States Treasury Department, issued non-binding guidance on how it characterizes certain activities involving 
		virtual currencies.</p>
		<h2>What determines bitcoin's price?</h2>
		<p>The price of a bitcoin is determined by supply and demand. When demand for bitcoins increases, the price increases, 
		and when demand falls, the price falls. 
		<br>There is only a limited number of bitcoins in circulation and new bitcoins are created 
		at a predictable and decreasing rate, which means that demand must follow this level of inflation to keep the price stable.
		Because Bitcoin is still a relatively small market compared to what it could be, it doesn't take significant amounts of 
		money to move the market price up or down, and thus the price of a bitcoin is still very volatile.</p>
