	<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>A dapp is a service(or you can say application) that enables direct interaction between end users and 
			providers (e.g. connecting buyers and sellers in some marketplace, owners and storers in file storage).
			Decentralized applications are applications which run on a P2P network of computers, instead of a one computer. 
			They are considered to be a form of software program designed to function on the internet without being controlled by a single entity.
			ÐApps can have front-end code and user interfaces written in any language, just like a traditional application, which can make calls to its backend.
		</p>
	<h2>Features of Dapp</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Open Source</li><p>Ideally, it should be governed by autonomy and all changes must be decided by the consensus, or a majority,
			of its users. Its code base should be available for scrutiny. Or simply,it should exhibit transparency.</p>
			<li>Decentralized</li><p>All records of the application’s operation must be stored on a public and decentralized blockchain 
			to avoid pitfalls of centralization.</p>
			<li>Incentivized</li><p> Validators of the blockchain should be incentivized by rewarding them accordingly with cryptographic tokens.</p>
			<li>Protocol</li><p>The application community must agree on a cryptographic algorithm to show proof of value. For example, Bitcoin uses Proof of Work (PoW)
			and Ethereum is currently using PoW with plans for a hybrid PoW/Proof of Stake (PoS)5 in the future.</p>
			<p>If we adhere to the above definition, the first Dapp was in fact Bitcoin itself. <a href="www.cbsblockchain.org/bitcoin" target="_blank">Bitcoin</a> is an implemented blockchain solution that arose from
			problems revolving around centralization and censorship. One can say Bitcoin is a self-sustaining public ledger that allows efficient 
			transactions without intermediaries and centralized authorities.</p>
		</ul>
	<h2>Ethereum</h2>
		<p>Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts/dapp: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference.
		These apps run on a custom built blockchain, an enormously powerful shared global infrastructure that can move value around and represent the ownership of property. 
		This enables developers to create markets, store registries of debts or promises, move funds in accordance with instructions given long in the past 
		(like a will or a futures contract) and many other things that have not been invented yet, all without a middle man or counterparty risk.</p>
	<h2>Dapps on Ethereum</h2>
		<p>The Ethereum Platform created a protocol for building decentralized applications.It provides a decentralized Turing-complete virtual machine, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which
		execute scripts using an international network of public nodes. ÐApps are more flexible, transparent, distributed, and resilient and have a better incentivized structure software model.
		You may think of Ethereum as, for the lack of a better analogy, the Mother of Dapps. Armed with its very own language, Solidity(language for creating smart contracts).
		</p>
	<h2>Successful Dapps</h2>
		<ul>
			
			<li>Golem</li><p>The Golem project aims to create the first global market for idle computer power.If it turns out to be sustainably successful
			frictionless sharing and pooling of resources on the network may be a reality soon, e.g. CGI artists will be able to rent computing resources from other users to render an image quicker.
			</p>
			<li>Augur</li><p>Augur aims to combine the concept of prediction markets with the power of decentralised network to create a forecasting tool, for potential trading gains.</p>
			<li>Aragon</li><p> Aragon is another ambitious project. It aims to disintermediate human trade, and allows you to manage entire organizations using the blockchain. By removing geographical 
			borders and paperwork, the Aragon Network aims to act as a digital jurisdiction that is extremely convenient for everyone to operate on.</p>
			
		</ul>
	
	
	<h2>To kickstart a Dapp project</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Create a whitepaper</li><p>Your whitepaper should address a problem you wish to solve. It should clearly state the intentions and goals of the Dapp. Describe the plans for your 
			Dapp’s token distribution, and how you intend to go about doing it. Decide on a mechanism for establishing consensus, and recruit your management and development team. Be honest with 
			any technical difficulties you foresee and state your technical requirements clearly.</p>
			<li>Gain a following</li><p> Discuss your plan ,your goals and form a community around it . Value  their feedback and revise your plans accordingly.</p>
			<li>Start a crowd-sale</li><p>Once the Dapp has gained enough momentum, decide on a date to receive token funding. The Dapp’s crowd sale website should have all the
			information that an investor may need. Basically start the <a href="http://cbsblockchain.org/ico" target="_blank">ICO</a></p>
			<li>Creat your Dapp</li><p>That's it ,now only thing left is to implement your project . Begin development, welcome new developers and interest groups.</p>
